# BilliardSimulation
Small Class for 2D discs, that allows collisions and trajectories to be calculated.

Serves as a visualisation of the stability analysis of elastic 2D disc collisions.

May be improved with 3D spheres, angular momentum and drag down the road.

## Animations:

**stable:** Discs situated on a line with equal distances smaller than twice the diameter.

**unstable:** Discs situated on a line with equal distances larger than twice the diameter.

**alternating:** Alternating small and large distances, which produce a stable fixed point in total.

**offset:** Discs with an offset producing a stable fixed point.

**logarithmic:** logarithmic decreasing distances, angle diverges at first and converges at the end.
